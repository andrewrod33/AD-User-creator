AD-User-creator
===============
		it currently generates 500 users, you can edit the for loop to create more or less. 
		I would also recommend changing the "path" variable to match your DC, otherwise it wont work.
		currently, it writes to an output.txt in the directory, you just need to copy/paste contents in a powershell window
